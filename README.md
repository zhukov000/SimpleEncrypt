# SimpleEncrypt
Application (console tool + library) for encrypt (simple replacement and permutations)

## How To Use

This application can be used for encryption and decryption plain-text files with using PASSWORD and autogenerated gamma (saved in .key file)

### Allows two mode:
1) Encrypt mode - you must run application with option -encrypt and set option -file, for example:

  EncryptTool -encrypt -file=file.txt

Also you can specify password with using optiony -pass

  EncryptTool -encrypt -file=file.txt -pass=password

If you don't specify this option you will have to set password after run application. As a result of encryption two files will be created: 
* file.enc - contains encrypted data
* file.key - contains key (gamma) for decrypt

2) Decrypt mode - you must run application with option -decrypt and set options -file and -key, for example:

  EncryptTool -decrypt -file=file.enc -pass=password -key=file.key

#### CAUTION! Strongly recomended use only local path in file-name, because current version can't parse corectly spaces in filepath
